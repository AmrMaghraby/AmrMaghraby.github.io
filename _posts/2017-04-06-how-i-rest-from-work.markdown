## Introduction About Me 

My name is Amr Ahmed Maghraby and I am 4th year B.S. Computer Science in Arab Academy for Science, Maritime, and Technology, Egypt. I am interested in Data Science, Computer Vision.
I am a competent programmer in C, C++, Java, Python. I have worked in the Research field, I took my first internship as a computer vision researcher during my 3rd year in college and published my first paper in MUM conference . The subject of my first paper was about using computer vision algorithms to replace medical devices for detecting Hepatitis C virus. I invented a small device which will be used to capture images of blood samples.
I also did some projects on GitHub, and I joined competitive programming communities for more than 3 years. On my GitHub profile, there are about ~170 solved problems. In my whole life, I have solved more than 990 problems (according to a2oj statistics).

## The Application Process

This is the second time I am applying to the GSoC program. I tried one years ago without make previous contribution to any organization or even to Github community. I submitted my proposal very late without comminicating with mentors enough time as it supposed to.

This year i started my preparation in an organized way.
Following my timeline :

1: I have started by searching for last season projects and read about accepted people in red hen lab and their projects. I have spent about more than two weeks tracing thier codes and understanding their approaches and learn from their mindset.

2: Next I found awesome project last year about speech recognition, I loved the tools and approaches used to achieve the goal. I started to mail that person to take some advices.

3: Mailing Red Hen Lab Professors and started to decide to work on problems related to CNN - RNN (which I took it's experience from prevouis projects). I have started implementing some papers to be considered as contribution on my github. The best one which was stated on my proposal Automated Image Caption [CNN - RNN Approach].

4: After several weeks Red Hen Lab stated their projects recommended on students in that summer, one of them was OCR on vedioes (very close to my skills). I started to read several papers to choose which one will be implemented in that projects, and I have searched for the data set to be chosen for training.


I will be posting here my updates as I make updates. Stay Tuned!!
