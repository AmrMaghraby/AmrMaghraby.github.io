## Deliverables for Week 4:

This week I have finished Recognition Branch which takes features as input and converts it to the expected tokens. After that new challenge unexpected meet me which requires me to prepare the dataset as the input is not a rectangle of four corners it is a polygon, so we need to preprocess the input (Next Week assignment).

Tasks left till now: preprocessing input to be rectangle instead of the polygon to learn Geo map to predict suitable boundary box.

Stay Tuned for more updates !!!!
