## Deliverables for Week 2:

In week 2 I have implemented a Geo map successfully, which predicts the four coordinates of boundary boxes and the angle rotation.

This code has been trained on anther small data set (showcase model) Minist numbers to predict the numbers on rotated un-clear images.

Stay tuned for next week progress.
